# uc-historic-data-importer

Import UC mongo backup into hbase.


A Makefile wraps some of the gradle and docker-compose commands to give a
more unified basic set of operations. These can be checked by running:

```
$ make help
```

## Build

Ensure a JVM is installed and run the gradle wrapper.

```
make build
```

## Run full local stack

A full local stack can be run using the provided Dockerfile and Docker
Compose configuration. The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build so no
pre-compilation is required.

```
make up
```

The environment can be stopped without losing any data:

```
make down
```

Or completely removed including all data volumes:

```
make destroy
```

## Run in an IDE

First bring up the containerized versions of hbase, aws and dks:

```
make up-ancillary
```

Then arrange for their docker level network names and IPs to be in your hosts files:

```
make hosts
```

Create a run configuration with the environment variable `SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION`
pointing to `resources/application-ide.properties` and a main class of
`app.UcHistoricDataImporterApplication`, and run this.

## Getting logs

The services are listed in the `docker-compose.yaml` file and logs can be
retrieved for all services, or for a subset.

```
docker-compose logs aws-s3
```

The logs can be followed so new lines are automatically shown.

```
docker-compose logs -f aws-s3
```

The dks logs live in the containers so to get the logs after a run these targets are provided:

```
make dks-logs-http
make dks-logs-https
```

## UC laptops

This is a one time activity.

### Java

Install a JDK underneath your home directory, one way to do this is with
[sdkman](https://sdkman.io).

Once sdkman is installed and initialised you can install a jdk with e.g.:

```
sdk install java 8.0.222-zulu
```

Make sure that JAVA_HOME is set after this completes, start a new shell first
but if it is still not set you may need to add a line to your `.bashrc` thus:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/Users/<your-username>/.sdkman/candidates/java/current
```

then have it set in your current session by executing

```
exec bash
```

### Gradle wrapper

Update the project's gradle wrapper properties file to include a gradle
repository that can be accessed from a UC laptop. From the project root
directory:

```
cd setup
./wrapper.sh ../gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
```

A backup of the original file will created at
`./gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties.backup.1`

### Gradle.org certificates

The gradle.org certificate chain must be inserted into your local java
truststore:

```
cd setup # if not already there.
./certificates.sh path-to-truststore
# e.g.
./certificates.sh $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts
```

..again a backup will be created at (in the example above)

`$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts.backup.1`.

### Run a gradle build

From the project root first ensure no gradle daemons are running.

```
./gradlew --stop
```

Then run a gradle build
```
./gradlew build
```

To ensure the dockerized setup is functional, first generate the self-signed
certificates needed for local development (from the project root):

```
./truststores.sh
```
or
```
make jks
```

Then bring up the containers:

```
make up
```

Note that you are at the mercy of the quarry house wifi here as there are a
number of large docker image downloads.
